# UNLV ACM Website

## Structure

The structure is very simple, one html file (index), one stylesheet (style.css), 
and one javascript file (script.js). These are all linked in the .html file.
Any more than this is potentially unnecessary (This is arguable, more pages could be added)

## Removed

* Calendar
* Contact
* Submission
* Several .css files (some were to support different screen size; see: todo)

## Todo

* New ICPC Picture and potentially an external link to their website
* Support Different Screen Size
* Social Media Icons so we can remove the link
* New Logo (Potentially new colors)
* More content (A lot of the old content was outdated)
* Add Workshops (Training Officers)
* Calendar
* Contact (maybe) and/or discord invitation
* RSO page link
* Officers
* Maybe we can integrate with Gunther for auto updates/discord feed
